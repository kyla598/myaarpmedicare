## Description


The <a href="https://www.myaarpmedicare.com.co">myaarpmedicare</a> project is a lightweight, educational React application designed to help users track Medicare-related expenses, receipts, and enrollment information in a simple, privacy-conscious interface. It provides an intuitive dashboard for logging expenses, uploading receipts, and generating summary reports to help users plan healthcare budgets. The app emphasizes accessibility and clarity: large fonts, clear labels, and straightforward workflows support older users or those new to web applications. It's intended as a sample project for developers learning front-end patterns—component-based structure, state management with React hooks, and modular CSS—while modeling careful handling of personal data (no backend included). Developers can extend it to add authentication, cloud storage for receipts, or integrations with third-party healthcare APIs. The repository contains example components for expense forms, receipt views, and headers, along with unit tests to demonstrate test-driven approaches. The code is intentionally simple and well-documented to make it easy to fork, modify, and deploy. This repository is ideal for developers, designers, and students who want a practical, respectful, and maintainable starting point for healthcare-focused web projects. While the name references Medicare for identification, this repository is not affiliated with any government agency or AARP and should be adapted before production use and accessibility best practices.
